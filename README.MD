# Magnetic anisotropy project
# The aim of this project is to study anisotropic properties of a ferromagnetic film sample.
# The magnetic film sample was rotated and subjected to an external magnetic field after and measured with a Kerr microscope. 
# The folders XXdeg contain measurement data from different angles with respect to the easy angle
